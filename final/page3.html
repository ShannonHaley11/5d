				<p>Grid layouts are the most economical in terms of the size of the store vs product amount. There is a lot of shelf space and straight lines for walking traffic, making it fast and convenient when you know what you're looking for. 
				<br><br>
				However, this layout can make people have to walk around and hunt for their product, creating frustration. It may feel like they're walking through a maze. </p>
