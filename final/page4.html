				<p>Racetrack layouts create a loop for customers to travel around. This exposes them to a specific path of products, and when these products relate to each other, people are more likely to buy them. 
				<br><br>
				This can also let customers revisit products they've already seen and maybe they will consider buying them again.</p>
