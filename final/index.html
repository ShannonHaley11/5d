			<h1>Anatomy of A Store</h1>
			<h2>And How It Can Make You Buy More</h2>

			<div class="p-container">
				<p>Do you ever find yourself going to a store and buying more than you intended? The layout of a store matters more than you think. 
				<br><br>
				Businesses carefully plan the way they set up their stores to maximize sales. They want to expose customers to as many products as possible to push them to buy more. There are many different types of layouts and the type that a business chooses depends on the products sold, size of the store, and overall budget. 
				<br><br>
				It's all about assessing the goals of the business and taking into account your customer experience to produce more sales.</p>
