				<p>Angular layouts are made up of curves. They create a feeling of elegance, and are usually used for stores with a small amount of expensive items. 
				<br><br>
 				This layout makes customers feel like they are shopping for specialty items and they feel okay with paying a lot of money. However, this layout doesn't allow for much shelf space. </p>
